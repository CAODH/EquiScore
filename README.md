Implementation of EquiScore, by Duanhua Cao ðŸ˜Š.

This repository contains all code, instructions and model weights necessary to **screen compounds** by EquiScore, eval EquiScore or to retrain a new model.

If you have any question, feel free to open an issue or reach out to us: [caodh@zju.edu](caodh@zju.edu).

## Dataset

If you want to train one of our models with the PDBscreen data you should to do:

1. download Preprocessed PDBscreen data from [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8049380)
2. uncompress the directory by tar command and place it into `data` such that you have the path `/EquiScore/data/training_data/PDBscreen`
3. see retraining EquiScore part for details.

## Setup Environment

We recommend people to set up the environment using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).

   Clone the current repo

   git clone git@github.com:CAODH/EquiScore.git

This is an example for how to set up a working conda environment to run the code (but make sure to use the correct pytorch, DGL, cuda versions or cpu only versions):

   `conda create --name EquiScore python=3.8`

   `conda activate EquiScore`

   and then install all pkgs in environment.yml file.

Fortunately! you slao can setup conda environment by command `conda env create -f environment.yml` and done!

## **Using the provided model weights to screen a compound for your target protein**

   We implemented a Screening.py python script, to help **anyone want to screen Hits from a compound library**.

   We provide a toy example under the ./data/sample_data folder for illustration.

### **ðŸš€just some steps need to do**

1. Docking compounds with target protein to get docking pose, EquiScore is robust to pose sources and you can choose any method you are familiar with to generate poses(**Glide,Vina,Surflex,Gold,LeDock**), or you can try a **deep learning method**.
2. Assume that you have obtained the results of the docking in the previous step. Then, get pocket region and compound pose.
   run script:

   `python get_pocket.py --docking_result ./data/sample_data/sample_compounds.sdf --recptor_pdb ./data/sample_data/sample_protein.pdb --single_sdf_save_path ./data/sample_data/tmp_sdfs --pocket_save_dir ./data/sample_data/tmp_pockets`
3. Then, you have all data to predict protein-ligand interaction by EquiScore! Be patient. This is the last step!

   `python Screening.py --ngpu 1 --test --test_path ./data/sample_data/ --test_name tmp_pockets --pred_save_path  ./data/test_results/       EquiScore_pred_for_tmp_pockets.pkl`
4. Util now, you get all prediction result in pred_save_path, and you can read it for select compound by yourself!

## **Using the provided model weights for evaluation and Reproduces the benchmark result**

   Just like screen compounds for a target, benchmark dataset have many targets for screen, so we implemented a script to calculate the results

### **just some steps need to set**

1. We provided Preprocessed pockets on zenodo (download pockets from [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8047224)). IF YOU WANT GET RAW DATASET PLEASE DOWNLOAD RAW DATA FROM REFERENCE PAPERS.
2. you need download the Preprocessed dataset and extract data to ./data/external_test_data.

   (for example, all pockets in DEKOIS2.0 docking by Glide SP should be extract into one dir like ./data/external_test_data/dekois2_pocket)
3. if you want to preprocessed data to get pocket , all pocket file name should contain '_active' for active ligand,'_decoy' for decoys and  all pocket in a dir for one benchmark dataset
4. run script (You can use the nohup command and output redirects as you normally like):

   `python independent_test_dist.py --test --test_path './data/external_test_data' --test_name dekois2_pocket --test_mode milti_pose`

   use **milti_pose** arg if one ligand have multi pose and set pose_num and **idx_style** in args ï¼Œsee args `--help for more details`

## **Retraining EquiScore ðŸ¤– Model**

### **Retraining EquiScore or fine tune your model is also very simnple!**

1. you need download the traing dataset , and extract pocket data to ./data/training_data/PDBscreen
   (You can also use your own private data, As long as it can fit to EquiScore after processing)
2. use uniport id to deduplicated data and split data in `./data/data_splits/screen_model/data_split_for_training.py`
   in this script, will help deduplicated dataset by uniport id and split train/val data and save data path into a pkl file

   like "train_keys.pkl, val_keys.pkl, test_keys.pkl"
3. run train.py script:

   `python train.py --ngpu 1 --train_keys your_keys_path --val_keys your_keys_path --test_keys_path your_keys_path`

   (**or if you want speed up training, please save data to LMDB database in dataset.py and add --lmdb_cache lmdb_cache_path** )
